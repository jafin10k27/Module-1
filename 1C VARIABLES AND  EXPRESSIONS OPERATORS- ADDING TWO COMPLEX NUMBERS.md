# Experiment No: 1c Python Basics - Simple Arithmetic Calculations

## AIM
To create a Python program to read two integers and perform simple arithmetic calculations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).


## ALGORITHM
Begin the program.

Read two integer inputs from the user using the input() function and convert them to integers.

Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).

Print the results of all operations.

Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020018
#Name-Mohamed Jafin S
#Write your code here
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print (a+b)
print (a-b)
print (a*b)
print (a/b)
print (a//b)
print (a%b)
print (a**b)

```
