# Experiment No: 1b Python Basics - Checking if Two Names are the Same

## AIM  
To create a Python program to check whether two persons' names are the same and print the result as True or False.

## ALGORITHM  
Begin the program.

Take two names as input or assign them to variables.

Compare the two names using the equality operator (==).

Print the result (True if names are the same, False otherwise).

Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020018
# Name-Mohamed Jafin S
# Write your code here

myname = input()
yourname = input()

havesamename = myname==yourname

print(havesamename)
