## Experiment No: 1d Python Basics - Checking Eligibility to Vote

## AIM  
To create a Python program to check whether a person is eligible to cast his vote.

## ALGORITHM  
Begin the program.

Read the person's age as input using the input() function and convert it to an integer.

Check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.

If yes, print that the person is eligible to vote.

Otherwise, print that the person is not eligible to vote.

Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-
# Name-
# Write your code here

a=int(input())
if a >= 18 :
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not Eligible")
```
