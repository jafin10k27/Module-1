# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Finding Minimum of Three Numbers Using Conditional Expression

## AIM  
To create a Python program to find the minimum among three integer numbers using a conditional expression (ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
Begin the program.

Read three integer inputs from the user using the input() function and convert them to integers.

Use nested conditional expressions (ternary operators) to find the minimum among the three numbers.

Print the minimum number.

Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020018
# Name-Mohamed Jafin S
# Write your code here

a = eval(input())
b = eval(input())
c = eval(input())

if a<b and a<c:
    print(f"The minimum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {a}")
elif b<a and b<c:
    print(f"The minimum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {b}")
else:
    print(f"The minimum of {a}, {b}, {c} is {c}")
```
